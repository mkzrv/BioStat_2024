## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
mean(c(20, 68, 45, 76, 41, 36, 13, 52, 77, 53, 70, 73))
```

```{r}
var(c(65.14, 49.87, 34.11, 43.23, 35.72, 35.73, 70.86))
```

```{r}
sd(c(65.14, 49.87, 34.11, 43.23, 35.72, 35.73, 70.86))
```

```{r}
describe(data)
```


```{r}
  data %>%
  select(`Группа крови`, `Рост`)
```

```{r}
data %>%
  select(`Группа`, where(is.numeric) & (function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) > 10))
```

```{r}
data %>%
  select(where(is.numeric))
```

```{r}
data %>%
  slice(1:10)
```
